# 🔐 DoubleEncrypt512
### *Because if your encryption isn't overkill, is it even encryption?*

Welcome to **DoubleEncrypt512**, the only app that treats your grocery lists like top-secret nuclear codes. We’ve combined the nostalgia of **Android Holo Blue** with the "don't-mess-with-me" power of **512-bit entropy**.

## 🧐 What is this?
It’s a file vault for Android that uses **Two-Factor Physical Encryption**:
1.  **Factor 1:** Your phone’s internal hardware-backed Keystore (AES-256).
2.  **Factor 2:** A physical NFC tag (Mifare/ISO) that provides the secondary 256-bit entropy.

**The Result:** Your files are saved as `.dec` blobs. If a hacker steals your phone, they have nothing. If they steal your NFC tag, they have a piece of plastic. They need **BOTH** to see your secret memes.

## 🚀 Features
* **🚫 100% Ad-Free:** I hate ads as much as you do. No banners, no pop-ups, no trackers. Just code.
* **🔵 Holo UI:** Clean, dark, and blue—back to when Android felt like an industrial tool, not a bubbly toy.
* **🔋 512-bit Key Synergy:** We mix hardware keys with physical tag data. It’s a digital "nuclear launch" suitcase.
* **📄 The .dec Standard:** Securely encrypted raw data output.
* **🏷️ Physical Keycard:** Use your office badge, bus pass, or any NFC sticker as your master key.

## 🔓 Is this Open Source?
~~**Not yet.** I am currently polishing the code for the **Initial Release (V1.0)**, which is coming in the next few days.~~
**YES**! I managed to polish the app, make it better and now, the Source Code is out! Use it **Wisely**!

* **Issues:** Please open an issue on GitHub if the app crashes or if you have a "big brain" idea for an update.
* **Testers:** If you have weird NFC tags (hotel keys, old bus cards, etc.) and want to test compatibility, testers are **very welcome!**

## 🛠 How to Use
1.  **The Initiation:** Open the app and tap your NFC tag to initialize the vault.
2.  **The Lockdown:** Select a file, tap your tag, and get your `.dec` file.
3.  **The Rescue:** Select the `.dec` file, tap the **exact same tag**, and unlock your data.

## ⚠️ Warning
* **Don't Lose Your Tag:** If you lose your NFC tag, your files are gone. Permanently. Not even the FBI can help you.
* **Dog Danger:** If your dog eats your NFC keycard, you lose your data. Please keep your keys away from hungry pets.
