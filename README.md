🔐 DoubleEncrypt512
Because if your encryption isn't overkill, is it even encryption?
Welcome to DoubleEncrypt512, the only app that treats your grocery lists like top-secret nuclear codes. We’ve combined the nostalgia of Android Holo Blue with the "don't-mess-with-me" power of 512-bit entropy.

🧐 What is this?
It’s a file vault for Android that uses Two-Factor Physical Encryption:

Factor 1: Your phone’s internal hardware-backed Keystore (AES-256).

Factor 2: A physical NFC tag (Mifare/ISO) that provides the secondary 256-bit entropy.

Result: Your files are saved as .dec blobs. If a hacker steals your phone, they have nothing. If they steal your NFC tag, they have a piece of plastic. They need both to see your secret memes.

🚀 Features
🚫 100% Ad-Free: I hate ads as much as you do. There are no banners, no pop-ups, and no trackers. Just code.

Holo UI: Clean, dark, and blue—back to when Android felt like an industrial tool, not a bubbly toy.

512-bit Key Synergy: We mix hardware keys with physical tag data. It’s a digital "nuclear launch" suitcase.

The .dec Standard: Securely encrypted raw data output.

Physical Keycard: Use your office badge, bus pass, or any NFC sticker as your master key.

💰 The "Play Store" Goal & Source Code
I am a solo developer and I want to get this app onto the Google Play Store! However, Google charges a one-time developer fee of $25 (~€25).

The Deal:

Source Code Release: I will release the full source code under the GPL License as soon as we hit the €25 goal.

Hall of Fame: Every single donor will have their name (or nickname) permanently immortalized on this GitHub page in the "Donors" section below.

☕ Support the goal on Ko-fi

🤝 Testers & Issues Welcome!
Found a bug? Want to suggest a feature?

Issues: Please open an issue on GitHub if the app crashes or if you have a "big brain" idea for an update.

Testers: If you have weird NFC tags (hotel keys, old bus cards, etc.) and want to test the compatibility, let me know!

⚖️ Licensing
This project is GPL Licensed. You are free to use, modify, and share the code (once released), provided you give credit to the original author.

🛠 How to Use
The Initiation: Open the app and tap your NFC tag to initialize the vault.

The Lockdown: Select a file, tap your tag, and get your .dec file.

The Rescue: Select the .dec file, tap the exact same tag, and unlock your data.

⚠️ Warning
Don't Lose Your Tag: If you lose your NFC tag, your files are gone. Permanently.

Dog Danger: If your dog eats your NFC keycard, you lose your data. Please keep your keys away from hungry pets.
