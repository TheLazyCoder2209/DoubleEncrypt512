🔐 DoubleEncrypt512
Because if your encryption isn't overkill, is it even encryption?

Welcome to DoubleEncrypt512, the only app that treats your grocery lists like top-secret nuclear codes. We’ve combined the nostalgia of Android Holo Blue with the "don't-mess-with-me" power of 512-bit cascading entropy.

🧐 What is this?
It’s a high-security file vault for Android that utilizes Three-Factor Physical Binding:

Factor 1: Your phone’s internal Hardware-backed Keystore (TEE-isolated).

Factor 2: Your Biometric Signature (Fingerprint required to "unlock" the vault in RAM).

Factor 3: A physical NFC Tag (The physical "pointer" to your 512-bit master key).

The Result: Your files are saved as .vlt blobs. If a hacker steals your phone, they have nothing. If they steal your NFC tag, they have a piece of plastic. They need THE PHONE + THE TAG + YOUR FINGER to see your secret memes.

🚀 Features
🚫 100% Ad-Free: No banners, no pop-ups, no trackers. Just raw, industrial-grade code.

🔵 Holo UI: Clean, dark, and blue—back to when Android felt like a tool for power users, not a bubbly toy.

🔋 True 512-bit Cascade: We don't just use one key. We split 512 bits of entropy into two 256-bit AES-GCM layers. If one layer is ever broken, the second layer is there to laugh at the attacker.

🧬 Biometric Binding: The master key is physically locked inside your phone's secure hardware. It only releases its grip when your fingerprint is verified.

📄 The .vlt Standard: Securely encrypted raw data output. No headers, no metadata leaks—just an opaque wall of math.

🏷️ Physical Keycard: Use your office badge, bus pass, or any NFC sticker as your master key pointer.

🔓 Is this Open Source?
YES! After intensive polishing and security hardening, the Source Code is out! Use it Wisely.

🤝 Community & Support
Issues: Found a bug? Open an issue on GitHub.

Testers: If you have exotic NFC tags (hotel keys, old bus cards, etc.), help us test compatibility!

⚖️ Licensing
This project is GPL Licensed. You are free to use, modify, and share the code, provided you give credit to the original author (TheLazyCoder).

🛠 How to Use
The Initiation: Open the app and tap your NFC tag. You'll be asked to scan your finger to bind the 512-bit key to your hardware.

The Lockdown: Select a file, tap your tag, scan your finger, and generate your .vlt file.

The Rescue: Select the .vlt file, tap the exact same tag, verify your identity, and restore your data.

⚠️ Warning
Don't Lose Your Tag: If you lose your NFC tag, your files are gone. Permanently. Not even a supercomputer can help you.

Dog Danger: If your dog eats your NFC keycard, you lose your data. Please keep your physical keys away from hungry pets.
